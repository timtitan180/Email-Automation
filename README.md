Email-Automation(Gmail)
A terminal application that takes your email credentials and lets you send emails via the command line(works only for Gmail servers at the moment)

What I learned building this application:
-How to use Smtplib module
-email.message module
-ssl module and the importance of security when dealing working with a client session
