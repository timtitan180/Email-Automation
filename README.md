Email-Automation(Gmail)


A terminal application that takes your email credentials and lets you send emails via the command line(works only for Gmail servers at the moment)

What I learned building this application:
 How to use Smtplib module\n
 How to use the email.message module to format emails\n
ssl module and the importance of securely sending emails\n 
How to break down important code into functions to make the script more organized
